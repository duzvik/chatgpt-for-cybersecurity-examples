*OpenAI Response: This event is a process creation event generated by Sysmon. It appears that a Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe) was created with parameters to run a Powershell script. The process was created by user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and it is likely that the system was compromised and the attacker is running a malicious script.*

`OpenAI prompt: analyze the parameters and the powershell script, decode the base64 argument, and explain what the script does.`

*OpenAI Response: The parameters of the Powershell script indicate that the script is attempting to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code. The base64 argument is likely a payload containing malicious code. After decoding the base64 argument, it appears that the script is attempting to download a file from a remote source and then execute it. This type of attack is often used to download and execute malware on the system.*
